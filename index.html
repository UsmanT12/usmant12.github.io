          <p>
            My name is <strong>Usman Tahir</strong>, and I am a Computer Science
            major at
            <strong
              >California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal
              Poly SLO)</strong
            >. I’m passionate about building technology that creates meaningful
            impact and connects innovation with people.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey began at <strong>El Camino College</strong>, where I
            earned associate degrees in <strong>Mathematics</strong> and
            <strong>Physics</strong> along with a
            <strong>Certificate of Achievement in Computer Science</strong>,
            graduating with a <strong>3.87 GPA</strong>. During my last year, I
            became apart of the
            <strong>inaugural cohort of the Sharer Scholars Program</strong>, a
            leadership and academic excellence initiative that supports
            high-achieving STEM students. I also worked as a student
            <strong>
              Front Desk Worker at the MESA (Mathematics, Engineering & Science
              Achievement)</strong
            >
            program for 2 years, supporting students, managing data, and
            strengthening the STEM community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through the
            <strong>Computing Talent Initiative (CTI)</strong> program, I
            expanded my technical skills by completing the
            <strong>CTI Accelerate Program</strong> and contributing to
            open-source software during a
            <em>Google-sponsored micro-internship</em>. Later, as a
            <strong>Software Engineering Intern at CodeDay</strong>, I developed
            a <em>machine-learning image classifier</em> using Python, PCA, and
            NumPy to explore data-driven visual recognition.
          </p>

          <p>
            At <strong>Cal Poly SLO</strong>, I continue to grow as a
            <strong>Sharer Scholar</strong> and an active member of
            <strong>Hack4Impact</strong>, the <strong>Blockchain Club</strong>,
            and the <strong>CS AI Club</strong>. I also serve as a
            <strong
              >Junior Executive for the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA)
              Club</strong
            >, helping organize cultural and community-building events on
            campus. My current project, a <em>WNBA Stats Tracker</em>, combines
            my interests in sports analytics and software engineering by using
            Python, PostgreSQL, and React to analyze player performance data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching basketball,
            exploring nature, and continuous learning. I’m motivated by
            curiosity and a genuine desire to make technology accessible and
            impactful.
